  <strong> Project Description: </strong>
  Elbuy is a platform where people around Los Ba√±os can buy and sell
  their new or preloved items with a secure and fast transaction. Through
  this platform we can help other people to find affordable items within
  ELBI and also give them a chance to earn money by selling second-hand items.
